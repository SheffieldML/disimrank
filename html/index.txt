<h1>MATLAB Gaussian Process Transcrption Factor Target Ranking Toolbox</h1>

<p>This page contains a MATLAB implementation of the transcription
factor target ranking methodology based on Gaussian process
differential equation models.

<p>An R implementation of the same methods is available from the
authors upon request.

<h2>Author information</h2>

This package was created by <a
href="http://users.ics.tkk.fi/ahonkela/">Antti Honkela</a>.

RELEASEINFORMATION

<p>Minor fix to demPlotMef2Models.m.

<h3>Version 0.1</h3>

<p>This version includes scripts used to run the experiments in the
PNAS paper.

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>The PNAS experiments depend on a <a href="dros_data.mat">Drosophila
data set</a> (35 MB), which includes a pre-processed version of the <a
href="http://www.fruitfly.org">developmental expression time series
data</a> of Tomancak et al. as well as various <a
href="http://furlonglab.embl.de/data/">validation data sets</a>.  We
thank Dr. Tomancak for the kind permission to redistribute the data.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In order to run the demos, you need the above Drosophila data set.
The command <code>drosLoadData</code> (also used internally by many of
the scripts) will attempt to load it from the current working
directory and its subdirectory <code>data</code>.

<p>Models can be fitted for individual genes and the
results visualised using the command

<p><code>&gt; &gt; demPlotModels<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
</code>

<p>This will create independent visualisations of model for the
three repeated experiments, the last of which are:<br>
<img src="twi_singletarget.png" alt="Single-target model visualisation"><br>
<img src="twi_multitarget.png" alt="Multiple-target model visualisation">

<p>The package can also be used to rerun the rankings reported in the
paper.  This is a time-consiming process that may take several days in
serial execution.  If desired, these may nevertheless be run using
the command

<p><code>&gt; &gt; demRunRankings<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
</code>
